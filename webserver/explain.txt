I fixed the login handler to accept both HTML form submissions and JSON API requests, added logging, and provided a safe success fallback.

What I changed
- `routes/routes.go`:
  - Added imports: `encoding/json`, `log`, and `strings`.
  - Updated `LoginHandler` to:
    - Detect `Content-Type` and parse JSON payload when `application/json`.
    - Otherwise parse regular form data via `r.ParseForm()`.
    - Trim the `identifier` and validate both fields.
    - Log the incoming `Content-Type` and `identifier` for debugging.

Why this fixes "All fields are required"
- Previously the handler only used `r.FormValue(...)` and returned "All fields are required" when `identifier` or `password` were empty. If a client submitted JSON (or some other non-form content type), `r.FormValue` would return empty strings.
- By accepting JSON requests too, API clients that send JSON will now correctly populate `identifier` and `password`.

How to test locally
1. Run the server:

```bash
cd /home/swadhin/JOB/LEARNGO/awesome-go-beginner-projects/webserver
go run .
```

2. Test with a regular HTML form (open `http://localhost:8080/login` in a browser and submit). The form uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` by default and will be handled by the form branch.

3. Test with curl (form-encoded):

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "identifier=alice&password=secret" http://localhost:8080/login
```

4. Test with curl (JSON):

```bash
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identifier":"alice","password":"secret"}' http://localhost:8080/login
```

5. If login credentials are valid, the handler serves `static/login_success.html` if it exists; otherwise it redirects to `/`.

Debugging tips
- If you still see "All fields are required", examine the server logs for the `Content-Type` printed by the handler. It will help identify what the client is sending.
- Use browser DevTools Network tab to inspect the request headers and payload.

Notes
- I left the unused `functionality.Login` struct unchanged (as requested).
- If you prefer the API to always return JSON responses for API clients, we can add logic to return JSON errors/success for `application/json` requests instead of HTML responses/redirects.
